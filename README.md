# Sign Up Form

The idea of this small project was to create a simple  **Sign Up** form with basic validation. 

Even though you could do validation even using just html5 and form attributes or some libraries, I've decided to do all work in vanilla javascript and to be honest is was fun to remind yourself DOM API and how things look before ~~all these libraries and framework like react, react hook form, formik , yup or zod.~~ Just core stack html5/css3/js.

Also I've added imitation of fetch request just to show the flow of this small app and a greeting message to infom user that your request was successfully fullfilled.
